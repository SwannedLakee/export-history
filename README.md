# export-history

A simple script that exports my firefox history as a webpage. 


There is a [blog post](http://joereddington.com/6530/2018/12/12/experimenting-with-public-internet-history./) that talks about the reasons behind this, and there is also a [live example](http://flow.joereddington.com/history)

Currently all urls are stripped down to their domain name unless they appear on 'whitelist.txt' 

## TODO 
* Have light clustering (the same domain inthe same minute shouldn't occur) 
* Allow wildcards in whitelist 
* Make the whitelisted urls into clickable links
* Add some css
* Whitelist google from certain dates
